Perform inner join on sales and booking data on column destination name. We assume one to one mappings.
This will tell show us which of the bookings are related to current sales.

In the output I would aggregate some of the integers to show number (adults, children, infants, rooms, rate etc)

Show how bookings where made. Simple statement like:
 Case when platformName = 'MOBILE_WEB' THEN 1 as mob_web_count,
 CASE WHEN platformName = 'WEB' THEN 1 as web_count
etc.

I would this aggregate this up to a weekly level (probably use a partition by)
